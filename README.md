# TTCTracker
Ever look at google maps and it says that the next streetcar or bus is coming in 6 minutes for the past 30 minutes and you are wondering where the bus is? That's what this mini web app will tell you. It will show you where the buses and streetcars are located based on the real time API.

# API
[This](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-real-time-next-vehicle-arrival-nvas/) API was the API used for this project.
This project also uses OpenStreetMaps/React-Leaflet.
